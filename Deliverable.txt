For the first task, I looked in build.xml for where the tests and their outputs get formatted. 

I noticed that the formatter looks like this:

<formatter type="xml"/>

After a bit of Googling (https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html) to find out exactly what this line does and if I could change it to better suit my needs, I found that I could change and add some of its parameters, more specifically:

- Change the `type' parameter to `plain' to be more readable.
- Add the usefile=`false' parameter, which determines whether the output should be sent to a file or not.

With these new parameters, the altered <formatter/> looked like this:

<formatter type="plain" usefile="false"/>

When I pushed this change and Travis tried to build, there was an error that read:

[junit] Testcase: test20 took 0.004 sec
[junit] 	FAILED
[junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<[1*v+-1<0]> but was:<[1*v+-1<=0]>
[junit]    at za.ac.sun.cs.green.service.canonizer.SATCanonizerTest.finalCheck(SATCanonizerTest.java:43)
[junit]    at za.ac.sun.cs.green.service.canonizer.SATCanonizerTest.check(SATCanonizerTest.java:56)
[junit]    at za.ac.sun.cs.green.service.canonizer.SATCanonizerTest.test20(SATCanonizerTest.java:304)  

With this new information, I could go find the faulty test20 inside SATCanonizerTest, and found this line:
check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<0");

Using the information that the error gave me, I changed it to this:

check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<=0");

Pushed and built, and it worked.
